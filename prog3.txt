Description
    This program is ment to make a mailbox server for clients to pass messages in.

    
- THIS WILL ONLY RUN ON LINUX -

Algorithms and libraries used:
    As for Algorithms, nothing significant was used.
List of Libraries:
//for c style input and output
    #include<stdio.h>
// for c string functions    
    #include<string.h>
// for stoi
    #include<stdlib.h>
// for sockets
    #include<sys/socket.h>
// for the inet_addr
    #include<arpa/inet.h> 
// for the write command
    #include<unistd.h>
// for threading
    #include<pthread.h> 
        
Functions and Program structure

dcip
    the main function starts up a server and handles main memory
    The other functions handle what happens when a client connects to a server
    
dciprm
    very simple client that sends a very specific kill message to server
    
client.py
    python client given from the project description 
    https://d2l.sdbor.edu/content/enforced/2015FA/777862-CSC_456_M001_2016SP_538486/program3.html
    handles simple connections to server

List of functions:
    //global handlers
    bool allocateGlobals(char *argv[]);
    void deallocateGlobals(char *argv[]);

    //checks the argc value
    bool checkArgc(int argc);

    //handles the argments passed from the python client
    bool checkArgments(char *currentArg, int sock);

    //handles specific client commands
    void handleRead(int mailBox, int sock);
    void handleWrite(int mailBox, int sock);
    
    //the thread function - provided by
    http://www.binarytides.com/server-client-example-c-sockets-linux/
    void *connection_handler(void *);

Compiling the program:
    There is a make file provide. Using the make command will compile the
program. 
Also the command: "g++ -pthread -o dipc DIPC.cpp -std=c++11" will as well for the main program
as well as: "g++ -pthread -o dipcrm dipcrm.c" for the removal program
and python client.py works for running the client

Testing and Verification:
    The code was tested by manually running the program. Using the python
    client.
    Bug - The client works spotty at best
    Bug - It was increadibly difficult to test this program
    Bug - The client overall, barely works - what it recieves often lags a command behind
    
    Bug - Does not check for deadlocks
    

Submitted Files:
    prog3.pdf, DICP.cpp, Makefile, dipcrm.c, client.py
    
prog3.pdf = This descriptive document of this project
DICP.cpp  = The code for this project
Makefile  = compiling tool for code
dipcrm.c  = removal client code
client.py = basic python client that can kindof talk to the server


-ClERIFICATION
due to this from the program description:
"First line will have a "r" for read, "w" for write, or "q" for  quit and the mailbox number.   
A line is text and then newline - correct?"
 
 because of this the program expects an enter after a command such as r 1 or w 4.


-FAILURES-
Does not check for deadlocks - only deadlock being if a writer never finishes writing.
Also does not use Deamon functionality

- side note: I'm not proud of this program... I hated every minute of it.
